# My Azure AI & ML Architect Learning Journey



### ðŸ‘‹ About This Repository

Welcome! I am a professional Cloud Solution Architect (Azure) currently expanding my expertise into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This repository documents my learning journey, tracks my progress, and serves as a portfolio of my skills and projects.

My goal is to bridge the gap between cloud infrastructure and intelligent applications, mastering the skills required to design, build, and govern enterprise-grade AI solutions on Azure.

**Current Focus:** [ ] Phase 1: Mastering Applied AI Services & Azure OpenAI

## ðŸš€ The Evolvement Plan

This plan is structured in four phases, taking me from my foundation as a Cloud Architect to a specialized AI Architect.

### Phase 1: Master "Applied AI" (The Architect's Quickest Win)

* **Folder:** `[01-Applied-AI-Services](./01-Applied-AI-Services/)`
* **Goal:** Master the integration of pre-built AI models to solve business problems.
* **Key Learnings & Progress:**
    * [ ] **Azure OpenAI:** Deploy and manage models, security, and cost.
    * [ ] **Azure AI Search:** Index data for AI.
    * [ ] **The RAG Pattern:** Master Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
    * [ ] **Other AI Services:** Understand Vision, Speech, and Language.
* **Target Certification:**
    * [ ] **AI-102: Azure AI Solution**
* **Featured Project:**
    * [ ] **[RAG Pattern Demo](./01-Applied-AI-Services/projects/RAG-Pattern-Demo/):** A "chat with your data" app using Azure OpenAI and AI Search, deployed securely with Bicep/Terraform.

### Phase 2: Build the Data Foundation (The "Data Engineering" Crossover)

* **Folder:** `[02-Data-Foundation](./02-Data-Foundation/)`
* **Goal:** Understand how to architect the data platforms that feed ML models.
* **Key Learnings & Progress:**
    * [ ] **Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) Gen2:** Architecting for analytics.
    * [ ] **Azure Data Factory (ADF):** Building ingestion and transformation pipelines.
    * [ ] **Azure Databricks:** Understanding its role in data science and its secure deployment (VNET Injection).
* **Target Certification:**
    * [ ] **DP-900: Azure Data Fundamentals**

### Phase 3: Dive into Custom ML & MLOps (The "Data Science" Crossover)

* **Folder:** `[03-MLOps](./03-MLOps/)`
* **Goal:** Learn the lifecycle of custom models and how to build the platform for MLOps.
* **Key Learnings & Progress:**
    * [ ] **Azure Machine Learning (AML) Studio:** The end-to-end platform.
    * [ ] **MLOps Lifecycle:** Understand training, registering, and deploying models.
    * [ ] **AML Endpoints:** Deploying models as secure, scalable REST APIs.
    * [ ] **AML Pipelines:** Automating the ML lifecycle.
* **Target Certification:**
    * [ ] **DP-100: Data Science Solution on Azure**

### Phase 4: Capstone Project & Strategy

* **Folder:** `[04-Capstone-Project](./04-Capstone-Project/)`
* **Goal:** Combine all skills into a single, enterprise-grade project.
* **Key Learnings & Progress:**
    * [ ] **WAF for ML:** Applying the Well-Architected Framework for ML.
    * [ ] **Python:** Gaining proficiency in Pandas and Scikit-learn.
* **Project Details:**
    * [ ] **[Enterprise RAG Solution](./04-Capstone-Project/):** An end-to-end "Chat with your Docs" solution.
        * **Features:** Secure (Private Endpoints), Automated (ADF + AML Pipelines), and Scalable (AML Endpoints).
